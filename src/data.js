    description: "Lilly has the unique ability to gain minions from the nemesis deck into her own deck as spells. She's a very effective damage dealer, and as long as at least a couple minions pop out, she can bring the team very far ahead with her sheer amount of damage she can output.",

    strategyTips: "Because Lilly can get free high quality spells by luring nemesis minions, she doesn't really have to worry about gaining new spells. Instead, she can focus on opening breaches and thinning out her deck to get more value out of her minions. Furthermore, holding onto her sparks and lures to more effectively snipe out minions is crucial.",

    suggestedOpening: "Opening your III breach goes a very long way in making Lilly's kit more consistent and more powerful. You can get your III breach open on turn 4 by focusing your III breach on turn one, buying a gem that gives 2 aether on turn 2, focusing your III breach again on turn 3, then opening your III breach on turn 4."

    description: "Shoshana chooses another mage at the start of the game to be her tether. Shoshana is able to give her tether cards with Imbued Ink, and get gems straight to her hand thanks to the Soul Facet she gives her ally."
    ,
    strategyTips: "Don't be fooled by her flowers and hippie aesthetic, Shoshana is no slouch when it comes to dishing out pain. In fact, she despises buying gems! Since she can gain gems pretty much freely due to her tether's Soul Facet, she should be focusing on doing anything else. Gain spells, crack open her III breach, and buy charges while getting a developed economy without even breaking a sweat. Keep in mind, the aether Shoshana gets from her signature card is *real aether*, she doesn't need to spend it on gaining a card for her tether. She can spend it on her breaches or on her charges as well."
    ,
    suggestedOpening: "Have her tether discard a card on turn one such that Shoshana can open her II breach and focus her III breach on her first turn. On her second turn, she buys a spell. She may also get a gem due to her tether playing soul facet, but don't sweat it; just buy a cheaper spell. On turn 3, once again, have her tether discard a card so Shoshana can selfishly use it to open her III breach. From here on, Shoshana can pick up another spell or two, while buying charges to pay back the fact that she begged her tether to give her money early on, it'll be worth it for them in the long term!"

    description: "Naftir's special Consuming Breach can hold up to three spells in it. Once it does, it discards all spells under it and does a burst of three damage! His starting deck can essentially deal 7 damage if he casts all his spells through his III breach, meaning that he technically has the highest starting damage in deck out of any mage in the game.",

    strategyTips: "Naftir's consuming breach acting as a +1 damage breach is better than just effectively destroying your starting spells and holding them in the breach in most cases. Buying and casting spells through his consuming breach is great, but look out for having more spells in hands than breach capacity. Getting a Link Token on his I breach is huge for circumventing this, along with card counting.",

    suggestedOpening: "Buy a spell on turn 1, open his II breach on turn 2, buy another spell on turn 3, then start buying charges until you can link up your I breach. Be careful, this opening can absolutely leave Naftir with more spells in hands than he can handle, but the sheer damage beatdown it generates is more than worth a couple awkward hands."

    description: "Bayli's signature card, Flaming Aura, let her essentially instantly cast a card in her hand, cycling her spells much faster than mages who have to wait a turn before their spells activate. Remember, you can cast any spells you prepare during your casting phase immediately. Her ability lets her both recur spells and cast spells quickly, making for a mean one-two punch.",

    strategyTips: "Bayli's III breach is extremely valuable to open, but simultaneously quite hard. She can essentially double dip on her III breach's +1 damage, returning Flaming Aura to her hand, preparing a new spell to the +1 damage breach, and casting that one for a cool +2 damage. Furthermore, she values having a thin deck more than most mages, since if she can draw right back into a spell the turn after fast-casting it, she can essentially just cast that spell every single turn!",

    suggestedOpening:" Open your II breach on turn one. Then, on turn 2, only cast one of your sparks and hold the other, then buy a spell. This bought spell will go straight into her hand on turn 3, letting her kill an early minion and absolutely save the day, especially at higher player counts. From there, she can opportunistically go in just about any direction, but remember to priortize opening up that III breach if possible."

    description: "Rhys can get up to 6 breaches opened! His gimmick is that he can choose artificial breaches to place in front of him to open at his leisure, rather than having to deal with focuses and inefficient aether inputs, every aether he puts into his breaches stays in his breaches. His signature card effectively giving three aether to focus breaches also goes a long way, as does his ability. Spending 6 charges to get two 5 cost spells already covers 10 aether of value, then on top of that he gets to put two spells from his discard pile straight into his hand!",

    strategyTips: "Rhys absolutely loves to use his ability to get two spells straight to hand, it's just an absurdly good deal. Honestly, it's still worth it even with plain jane 4 cost deal 3 damage spells, though obviously solid 5 cost spells are better. In general, I'd look more closely at when you can use the ability rather than worrying too much about getting those special breaches opened up.",

    suggestedOpening: "Rhys is a very open character, and honestly just about any conceivable opening is approximately viable. It's good to stay open and flexible with him. However, if he gets a lot of early breathing room, he can get away with this extremely greedy opening: Open a II breach on turn 1 and buy a gem. Then open a second II breach and hold all your sparks. Buy yet another gem on turn 3, and start buying charges and focusing breaches so that you can spam your ability as often as possible, loading up on spells straight to hand and having several breaches opened."
